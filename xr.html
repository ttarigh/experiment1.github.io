          <p>I collaborated with a colleague to develop an immersive software simulator based on Miserandino’s Spoon Theory to raise awareness for the unseen symptoms of chronic illness using Unity Engine, C# scripting, and Blender. The five-minute experience simulates the difficulty of doing the dishes, cleaning a room, and going to classes equipped with the lull of never-ending doctor’s voicemails in the background. It begins with a title sequence explaining SPOONs theory. We wrote C# scripts that automatically move the user from title sequence to the scene. This is also utilized in multiple other areas of the experience, such as when the user sits in the desk and are transported to the classroom for 20 seconds before automatically being transported back. Also, when the 5-minute timer ends, where the user is transported to the ending scene. The light, color, and orientation were animated to give users a slightly nauseous and fatigued experience by decreasing color and increasing motion blur slowly. The end of the experience included a call to action: increasing accessibility awareness.

            <p>“Private Server” is a personal AR project I invented as a solution to paparazzi. Using AR.js, A-frame, and Blender I created a symbol that would prompt a digital blockage of photographs taken by iphones. This was the first phase of this project, which only worked for photographs taken by smartphones. After demoing this to a few of my peers, it became clear to me that a website already embedded with the reactive symbol technology would have great usages for sex-workers performing online camera work who want to avoid accidental nudity. By placing the symbol anywhere on their body and recording their screen, the symbol-reactive technology would censor their body whenever the symbol is exposed. This has many applications outside of online sex work, and can be a wonderful safeguard for many people who do online streaming. For example, by placing the symbol on credit cards/ drivers licenses or other sensitive documents, users can avoid accidentally sharing them on the web. At this phase, this symbol can just be printed out by users at home and experimented with.

        <p>Hoth Intelligence is a medical startup currently in one of its mid-stages of acquiring funding. My role at Hoth is to work on making an educational Augmented Reality App that can stand on its own, and then later be added to the larger project. This app would allow people to inspect and annotate 3D medical renderes. Using my skills in Blender and Unity, I plan on executing this project with the mentorship of Hoth Intelligence this year. Here are the slides from my UI/UX Mockup of the app.</p>

        <p>My personal project “Scannable Underwear” is a meta-boxer that aims to help members of the LGBTQ+ community that suffer with gender dysphoria. With the prohibitive cost of gender-affirming surgery, as well as legislative and medical prohibitions in place, the possibility of getting gender-affirming bottom surgery is next to none. This is particularly egregious because a major risk factor for suicidality in transyouth includes major evidence for specific aspects of body dissatisfaction. My solution is a line of skin-toned underwear with a scannable augmented reality feature that displays the wearer with their preferred genitalia. When scanning these markers with any camera, the camera will prompt a 3D model of the wearer’s preferred genitalia. Without scanning, these underwear just look branded, which is great for queer youth living with transphobic parents. Additionally, since the renders of the 3D genitalia will be on remote servers, they can be altered even after the product goes out and with user input.

        <p>After being invited to pitch my “Scannable Underwear” to a multitude of underwear companies, I came across a small business in canada that had a wonderful mission to help trans individuals with body dysmorphia. After reaching out to them and hearing their beautiful mission statement, we discussed what I can do to help their company. They described to me that many people are skeptical of their product before buying because they do not believe the miraculous “tucking” effect that it has. In response, we have worked together to fine tune a try-on filter experience for customers to “try” before buying. This project was a delight and really opened my eyes to how helpful this technology can be for users everywhere.

        <p>It is so exciting to combine the role of AR developer with my other current position at En Route: Media and Marketing Consultant. This position is at the intersection of fashion, media, marketing, and software development on Meta's social media platforms. I develop 3D renders with LiDar scanners and edit them in Blender (or create them entirely in Blender) and export them to SparkAR, where I can build features that allow customers to "try on" jewelry with their smartphone before purchase. This has increased media impressions by over 50,000 impressions. At first, I was very focused on just exhibiting the jewelry in my filters, but they were not getting many hits as seen above. This is because I was failing to take the “beauty” aspect of filters in mind. After integrating face filters, like a light blush, a skin smoothing mask, and some lipstick, the success of the filters grew quickly!
          .These are the two most recent filters that have had much more success. As I mentioned previously, they include a blush, skin-smoother, and lipstick effect for the users. Since users appeared much more glamorous, these filters were much more successful. It created a correlation between wearing the company’s product and being beautiful.

        <p>JOBMII is a personal project and augmented reality performance art piece that I have planned for 2023. Using QR-codes, JOBMII will be a small 3D figure of oneself that can be placed on resumes. The job market was especially difficult in the last year, and many of my peers felt extreme desperation to lock some kind of job down. Especially for my peers who relied on obtaining a job to renew their immigration status, the relentless applying was dire. At first, JOBMII was meant to have practical applications. The small QR code could launch a render that would be animated and could speak about one’s job experiences. There would be a link that could take an employer to a calendar to set up a meeting. I believe for my own personal use, I will still implement it this way. But, as I thought about it more and more, I decided to turn this once helpful idea into something drastic: by making the 3D avatar respond negatively to a lack of attention. The avatar, after politely pitching itself, would start to get louder, more obnoxious, and cry/roll around around the resume, pleading and begging for a job. The heart of this project is to force the employer to literally turn off their phone/exit the device to ignore the palpable desperation in people’s voices to be employed. I am excited to implement this piece in the near future.
