            "Ready Companion" - Augmented Reality Campus Tour Guide App
          </p>
          <p>
            As the lead software engineer behind "Ready Companion," I embarked
            on a journey to create an innovative augmented reality (AR) mobile
            application tailored for iPhone users. Tasked with translating a
            visionary concept into a functional reality, I closely collaborated
            with the startup's founder to bring this cutting-edge project to
            life.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Ready Companion" is a pioneering campus tour guide application
            specifically designed to cater to the needs of college students. It
            harnesses the capabilities of Swift, RealityKit, and ARKit
            technologies to provide an immersive and interactive experience. By
            blending augmented reality with cutting-edge mobile technology, this
            app redefines the way students explore and interact with their
            campus surroundings.
          </p>
          <p>
            This version of "Ready Companion" represents our initial iteration,
            but we are already working on the next evolution. Our team is
            currently exploring the incorporation of 3D assets into geolocked
            spaces, pushing the boundaries of AR experiences. We're delving into
            the application of advanced tools, including shader languages, to
            further enhance the app's visual and interactive elements. This next
            phase aims to provide users with an even more immersive and dynamic
            campus exploration experience, marking an exciting evolution in the
            project's ongoing development.

            I spearheaded the development of Aesthetic Computer's innovative
            Happy Hands project, which involved creating a hands-free controller
            built upon Google's powerful MediaPipe platform, all implemented in
            JavaScript. My dedication to this endeavor led to the contribution
            of thousands of lines of code, driving the project's success. At
            present, we're in the process of crafting and blueprinting
            interactive augmented reality games that rely on hand gestures as
            the primary input method, opening up new realms of immersive
            gameplay.

            I am presently engaged in the development of an advertising campaign
            with a strong focus on augmented reality for Doobie, a cannabis
            delivery company. This strategic initiative emerges in the wake of
            Meta's recent announcement to intensify the proliferation of
            augmented reality (AR) ads, lending further credence to the
            potential of AR technology in transforming the advertising

          <p>
            The campaign I am orchestrating bridges the realms of guerrilla

            innovative and engaging approach that caters to the contemporary
            consumer's evolving preferences. In light of these developments, I

            It is so exciting to combine the role of AR developer with my other
            current position at En Route: Media and Marketing Consultant. This
            position is at the intersection of fashion, media, marketing, and
            software development on Meta's social media platforms. I develop 3D
            renders with LiDar scanners and edit them in Blender (or create them
            entirely in Blender) and export them to SparkAR, where I can build
            features that allow customers to "try on" jewelry with their
            smartphone before purchase. This has increased media impressions by
            over 50,000 impressions. At first, I was very focused on just
            exhibiting the jewelry in my filters, but they were not getting many
            hits as seen above. This is because I was failing to take the
            ‚Äúbeauty‚Äù aspect of filters in mind. After integrating face filters,
            like a light blush, a skin smoothing mask, and some lipstick, the
            success of the filters grew quickly! .These are the two most recent
            filters that have had much more success. As I mentioned previously,
            they include a blush, skin-smoother, and lipstick effect for the
            users. Since users appeared much more glamorous, these filters were
            much more successful. It created a correlation between wearing the
            company‚Äôs product and being beautiful.

            I collaborated with a colleague to develop an immersive software
            simulator based on Miserandino‚Äôs Spoon Theory to raise awareness for
            the unseen symptoms of chronic illness using Unity Engine, C#
            scripting, and Blender. The five-minute experience simulates the
            difficulty of doing the dishes, cleaning a room, and going to
            classes equipped with the lull of never-ending doctor‚Äôs voicemails
            in the background. It begins with a title sequence explaining SPOONs
            theory. We wrote C# scripts that automatically move the user from
            title sequence to the scene. This is also utilized in multiple other
            areas of the experience, such as when the user sits in the desk and
            are transported to the classroom for 20 seconds before automatically
            being transported back. Also, when the 5-minute timer ends, where
            the user is transported to the ending scene. The light, color, and
            orientation were animated to give users a slightly nauseous and
            fatigued experience by decreasing color and increasing motion blur
            slowly. The end of the experience included a call to action:
            increasing accessibility awareness.

            ‚ÄúPrivate Server‚Äù is a personal AR project I invented as a solution
            to paparazzi. Using AR.js, A-frame, and Blender I created a symbol
            that would prompt a digital blockage of photographs taken by
            iphones. This was the first phase of this project, which only worked
            for photographs taken by smartphones. After demoing this to a few of
            my peers, it became clear to me that a website already embedded with
            the reactive symbol technology would have great usages for
            sex-workers performing online camera work who want to avoid
            accidental nudity. By placing the symbol anywhere on their body and
            recording their screen, the symbol-reactive technology would censor
            their body whenever the symbol is exposed. This has many
            applications outside of online sex work, and can be a wonderful
            safeguard for many people who do online streaming. For example, by
            placing the symbol on credit cards/ drivers licenses or other
            sensitive documents, users can avoid accidentally sharing them on
            the web. At this phase, this symbol can just be printed out by users
            at home and experimented with.

            Hoth Intelligence is a medical startup currently in one of its
            mid-stages of acquiring funding. My role at Hoth is to work on
            making an educational Augmented Reality App that can stand on its
            own, and then later be added to the larger project. This app would
            allow people to inspect and annotate 3D medical renderes. Using my
            skills in Blender and Unity, I plan on executing this project with
            the mentorship of Hoth Intelligence this year. Here are the slides
            from my UI/UX Mockup of the app.

            My personal project ‚ÄúScannable Underwear‚Äù is a meta-boxer that aims
            to help members of the LGBTQ+ community that suffer with gender
            dysphoria. With the prohibitive cost of gender-affirming surgery, as
            well as legislative and medical prohibitions in place, the
            possibility of getting gender-affirming bottom surgery is next to
            none. This is particularly egregious because a major risk factor for
            suicidality in transyouth includes major evidence for specific
            aspects of body dissatisfaction. My solution is a line of skin-toned
            underwear with a scannable augmented reality feature that displays
            the wearer with their preferred genitalia. When scanning these
            markers with any camera, the camera will prompt a 3D model of the
            wearer‚Äôs preferred genitalia. Without scanning, these underwear just
            look branded, which is great for queer youth living with transphobic
            parents. Additionally, since the renders of the 3D genitalia will be
            on remote servers, they can be altered even after the product goes
            out and with user input.

            After being invited to pitch my ‚ÄúScannable Underwear‚Äù to a multitude
            of underwear companies, I came across a small business in canada
            that had a wonderful mission to help trans individuals with body
            dysmorphia. After reaching out to them and hearing their beautiful
            mission statement, we discussed what I can do to help their company.
            They described to me that many people are skeptical of their product
            before buying because they do not believe the miraculous ‚Äútucking‚Äù
            effect that it has. In response, we have worked together to fine
            tune a try-on filter experience for customers to ‚Äútry‚Äù before
            buying. This project was a delight and really opened my eyes to how
            helpful this technology can be for users everywhere.

            JOBMII is a personal project and augmented reality performance art
            piece that I have planned for 2023. Using QR-codes, JOBMII will be a
            small 3D figure of oneself that can be placed on resumes. The job
            market was especially difficult in the last year, and many of my
            peers felt extreme desperation to lock some kind of job down.
            Especially for my peers who relied on obtaining a job to renew their
            immigration status, the relentless applying was dire. At first,
            JOBMII was meant to have practical applications. The small QR code
            could launch a render that would be animated and could speak about
            one‚Äôs job experiences. There would be a link that could take an
            employer to a calendar to set up a meeting. I believe for my own
            personal use, I will still implement it this way. But, as I thought
            about it more and more, I decided to turn this once helpful idea
            into something drastic: by making the 3D avatar respond negatively
            to a lack of attention. The avatar, after politely pitching itself,
            would start to get louder, more obnoxious, and cry/roll around
            around the resume, pleading and begging for a job. The heart of this
            project is to force the employer to literally turn off their
            phone/exit the device to ignore the palpable desperation in people‚Äôs
            voices to be employed. I am excited to implement this piece in the
            near future. .
